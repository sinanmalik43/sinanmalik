This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Dr. John Tuthill’s lab at the University of Washington, where I anticipate completing my degree in Fall 2025. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 2018 (Go Slugs!). After completing my undergraduate studies with Dr. James Ackman, I worked as a Research Specialist in Dr. Ishmail Abdus-Saboor’s laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania for two years. During this time, I developed new, more objective assays, and computational tools to assess acute and chronic pain states in rodent models.

As a graduate student, my research aims to develop strategies to delineate neuronal pathways downstream of Drosophila nociceptors that drive aversive escape behaviors. I employ a combination of optogenetic activation, precise genetic silencing techniques, single-cell RNA sequencing, and neural electron microscopy circuit reconstruction to gain a comprehensive understanding of these pathways.

About me
------
I am Sinan Malik, and I recently completed my master's degree in Biology from Periyar University, Salem, India . I am currently a research intern in Dr. Binu's Neuronal Plasticity Group, where I explore behavioral plasticity and examine the learning processes of larval zebrafish. I am passionate about the neuronal, molecular, and circuit mechanisms underlying decision-making, multisensory integration, and information processing, including how this information is represented, transformed, and influenced by internal bodily states to regulate both conscious and instinctive behavior.
